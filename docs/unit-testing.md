# Unit Testing

Testing has been derrived from the Aurelia official skeleton project. It uses [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul).

Tests are put inside `test/unit-test`. It follows the same structure as what we have inside the `src` folder.

The most simple test could be seen inside `test/unit-test/value-converters/capitalise.spec.ts`.
